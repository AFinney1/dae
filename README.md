# Load Forecasting Notebook

This repo contains my attempt to develop various forecasting models using historical electrical load data from http://www.ercot.com/mktinfo/loadprofile/alp .
The end goal of each model is to predict the next 24 hours of load demand in 96 15-minute intervals.

The most important part of this repo is the **data_analyst_engineer_assessment_Austin2.ipynb**. This is based on an assessment I underwent. 
I decided to develop my submission as a learning exercise.
