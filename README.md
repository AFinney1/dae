# Load Forecasting Notebook

This repo contains my attempt to develop various forecasting models using historical electrical load data from http://www.ercot.com/mktinfo/loadprofile/alp .
The end goal of each model is to predict the nexthour of load demand in 4 15-minute intervals.

I have started a second fresh attempt at this project in the (github.com/afinney1/load_forecast_rw) repository.
